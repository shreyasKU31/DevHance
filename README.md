## The Problem: Your Portfolio is Broken.

Your GitHub shows your code, but not your architectural genius. Your Behance shows the final pixels, but not the tough design decisions you overcame. Today's portfolios are flat files‚Äîthey show the **what**, but completely miss the **how** and the **why**. Recruiters, clients, and collaborators never see the most valuable part of your work: **your process**.

This is **The Context Collapse**: the moment your dynamic, multi-faceted work is flattened into a single, lifeless screenshot.

## The Solution: This is `devhance`.

`devhance` is the professional stage for creators who think deeper. We provide the tools to transform every project into a compelling case study. Weave rich narratives between code snippets, connect design iterations to final outcomes, and build a behind-the-scenes look into your technical mastery.

**Stop just showing what you built. Start showcasing how you think.**
